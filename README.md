# Chaos_Ping_Pong
Ping-Pong with elements of chaotic and drive experience.
Events every 15 seconds creates obstacles to deal with the enemy, and every minute something truly chaotic is happening.
Abilities are provided to player to struggle with these problems.
Visuals are simple, but colorful. Right enogh to be in the center of chaos and understand everything.
Code here is strongly experemental. During education process I tried to reach every knowledge I could, so code might be messy.
I had to do this project when Java was not obvious for me in the start, and in the end I had no time to change fundamental issues.

For now, project is frozen until I get enough experience.

I'm planning to recreate it on Unity.
