# Chaos_Ping_Pong
Ping-Pong with elements of chaotic and drive experience.
Code here is strongly experemental. During education process I tried to use everything I can, so code sometimes is very bad.
I had to do this project during education, when Java was not obvious for me in the start, and in the end I had no time to change fundamental issues.

Known issues: Broken multithreading; Wrong OOP usage; non-centralised control system; Multiplayer (That was not teached; I tried to make multiplayer myself)
Tutorial was done for few days before deadline.

For now, project is frozen until I get enough experience.
