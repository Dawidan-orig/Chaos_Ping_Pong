# Chaos_Ping_Pong
Ping-Pong with elements of chaotic and drive experience.
Events every 15 seconds turn-tabling game process, and every minute something unusually chaotic happenins.
Abilities are provided to player to struggle with these problems and to deal with the enemy.
Visuals are simple, but colorful. Right enough when you are in the center of chaos to understand everything.
Code here is strongly experemental. During education process I tried to reach every knowledge I could, so code might be messy.
I had to do this project when Java was not obvious for me in the start, and in the end I had no time to change fundamental issues.

I'm planning to recreate it on Unity.
